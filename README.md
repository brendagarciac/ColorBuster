# ColorBuster
Introduction
The Color Buster game is a fun, interactive desktop application where tiles that match with the same color explode, 
creating new ones until no more matches are available in the board. The game was developed using the Java programming language 
on the software IntelliJ, following the MVC architecture.

Functionalities
One of the main functionalities added to my implementation of the ColorBuster game were the main screen that welcomes
users to the game, displays a dropdown to select from the three options of board size based on rows times columns, and 
asks user to enter their name. If the player does not enter anything in the textbox, a pop up shows up warning the user
that in order to play, they need to enter something for the field. Once the player clicks on the Play button in the main menu,
this screen is removed from the view, and the game’s screen becomes visible for the user to play. In this view, I added at the 
top another label next to the score to also reflect the player’s name as it was entered in the main screen. Additionally, the
game does get created based on the board size selection that the user makes at the start of the game as well.
